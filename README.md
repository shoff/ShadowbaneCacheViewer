# Shadowbane Cache File Viewer
Shadowbane Cache File Viewer is a work in progress application that allows the viewing of Shadowbane Cache files.

The actual .cache files that were contained in the game are the property of the owner of the Shadownbane intellectual property and are 
not contained in this repository. Don't bother asking me for them because I will not send them to you. Sorry.

You can try to find the cache files by registering to play on  [MagicBane](https://magicbane.com/)!

This project includes some incomplete 010 binary editor templates. The 010 editor is an excellent binary format discovery tool worth much, much more than the 
price Graeme Sweet charges for it. I have no stake in the company, I'm just a fan of affordable, well written and supported software. Check them out:
