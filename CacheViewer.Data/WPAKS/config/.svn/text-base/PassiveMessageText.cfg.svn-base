	TITLE= "Attributes"
	CATEGORY= RPG
		<TEXT>
			Though you'll choose one of Shadowbane's many promotion classes at level 10, you can still make meaningful choices for your character now.  Here's a primer on attributes.\n
			\n
			All attributes contribute towards your skill ratings.  They each affect combat in a different way.  Don't worry about making bad choices -- later in the game, you'll be able to redistribute points as you see fit.\n
			\n
			Strength determines the maximum damage you'll do with a strength-based melee weapon.  Most melee weapons are strength-based.  It also determines how much you can carry.  If your strength is higher than your dexterity, it'll be used to figure your attack rating (the value compared against your opponent's defense to determine whether or not you hit).  Strength is vital to fighters.\n
			\n
			Dexterity determines the maximum damage you'll do with a dexterity-based melee weapon, as well as all ranged weapons.  Daggers and unarmed weapons are dexterity-based.  Dexterity also plays a significant role in figuring your character's defense rating.  If your dexterity is higher than your strength, it'll also be used to figure attack rating.  Dexterity is very important for rogues.\n
			\n
			Constitution helps determines your hit points.  If you die too quickly, put some points in constitution!  Constitution is especially useful for fighters and rogues.\n
			\n
			Intelligence determines the maximum damage you'll do with damage and healing powers.  It's also good for raising all your skills, regardless of the number of skill points you've invested in them.  Intelligence is best for mages, but it's useful for all character classes because of the skill bonus.\n
			\n
			Spirit helps determine your mana.  It's also used to determine the minimum damage done by damage and healing powers.  If you're not a mage, you may wish to skip spirit entirely.

	TITLE= "Skills"
	CATEGORY= RPG
		<TEXT>
			Every time you level, you get skill points -- the number of points you receive is based on your level, race, and base class.  Healers and mages get more skill points than fighters and rogues, because they have to spend a lot of points on powers.\n
			\n
			Skill points are used to increase skills' and powers' rankings at class trainers.  It also costs gold.  You can browse your existing skill ranks by pressing K, and you can look at your powers by pressing P.  Don't worry about making bad decisions -- later in the game, you'll be able to redistribute your skill points if you wish.\n
			\n
			All skills will allow you to qualify for new powers when you reach certain ranks.\n
			\n
			Higher weapon skills improve your damage and attack rating, or ATR (chance to hit).  They also allow you to equip higher-level weapons.\n
			\n
			Higher armor skills improve your defense and allow you to equip higher-level armor.\n
			\n
			Higher spell focus skills improve your damage with damage and healing powers, as well as your chance to hit with aggressive powers.

	TITLE= "Powers"
	CATEGORY= Combat
		<TEXT>
			Most powers consume mana points (though some use health and stamina points instead).  If you run out of mana, rest by pressing Z.\n
			\n
			You can drag power icons anywhere on your screen for easier access.  If you drag them to your Hotbar, a hotkey will be set up automatically.\n
			\n			
			Every power has an associated focus skill.  Focus skills determine the amount of damage damage powers do, and the amount of healing healing powers do.  They're also used as prerequisites for higher-level powers.\n
			\n
			You need to spend skill points to make powers more effective.  Many powers can be directly trained -- at your class trainer, choose the individual power you're interested in.  For damage and healing powers, you'll also get a benefit from putting points into its focus skill.

			If you're a mage, higher-level cloth armor is available at tailors, and you may find some magic items on sages.  Unless you're using your weapon often, you probably don't want to invest in a better weapon unless it has interesting enchantments.

	TITLE= "Travel"
	CATEGORY= Travel
		<TEXT>
			As you've probably noticed, it can take a long time to run to your destination.  There are four other ways to travel -- runemaster teleportation, repledging, recalling, and summoning.\n
			\n
			Runemasters can teleport you between safeholds and open player cities.  Once you're in a player guild, you'll be able to use your guild's city's runemaster to teleport between cities in your nation as well.\n
			\n
			You can also use the runemaster to "repledge" to safeholds and open player cities.  It's just like teleportation, only it also removes you from your current guild and makes you a part of the target city's guild.  If you repledge to another city, as part of their guild, remember that you'll respawn at their tree when you die!\n
			\n
			Recall powers allow you to return to your guild's city whenever you'd like.  Anybody can buy and use a recall scroll from a Sage NPC.  Later in the game, mages can cast the power without a scroll!\n
			\n
			Summoning powers allow players to teleport other players to their location.  Healers receive the summon power at level 25.

			When you reach level 20, you'll be kicked to the mainland, where any player can attack you outside of non-player cities.  Get ready!\n
			\n
			While you'll be able to stay in the mainland safeholds until level 40, you may want to find a guild earlier.  You can flag yourself as "looking for guild" by going to your Guild menu and choosing "Looking for Guild."\n
			\n
			Alternatively, you can use the Who list to find official guild recruiters.  Type "/who" and choose to search by Status, then Recruiting.  You'll see a list of all of the online players whose guilds are looking for new members.  Send them tells!\n
			\n
			If you want to look for guilds without logging in to Shadowbane, you can review the server-specific message boards at chronicle.ubi.com.\n
			\n
			Finally, if you want to create your own guild, you can buy guild charters from Runemaster NPCs.  There are different guild charters for different combinations of races and classes, but these only matter if you play on a loreplay server.  Buy a guild charter and use it to create your own guild.

		<TEXT>
			Since you've reached level 20, you now qualify to train weapon mastery skills.  Weapon mastery skills improve your attack rating above and beyond the bonuses you get from your regular weapon skill.  You must have your regular weapon skill trained up to 80% (50% if you're a warrior).  Visit your trainer to browse your choices.\n
			\n
			If you use a weapon in combat, you'll almost certainly want to train your mastery skill.\n
			\n
			If you have 80% in your weapon skill, yet don't see any available weapon mastery skills, it may require a discipline to unlock.  Visit the Shadowbane website, chronicle.ubi.com, for more information on your specific class.

	TITLE= "Disciplines"

			At level 20, you qualify to take disciplines.  Disciplines are runestones that grant you special skills, powers, and/or attribute adjustments, diversifying your character.  There are many disciplines in Shadowbane, though you can't take all of them!  They're based on race and base class.  You can choose up to three at level 20.  At level 70, you can take a fourth.  Available discipline slots are represented by bars at the top of your Character Sheet.\n
			\n
			Disciplines are found on unique monsters, and their skills and powers can only be trained at special discipline trainers scattered throughout the world.  They're a popular trade item.  If you're interested in a specific discipline, use the /trade channel to find potential sellers.\n

		<TEXT>
			Welcome to the World Map.  You appear as a red circle, with an arrow indicating your heading.\n
			\n	
			Each shield represents a city.  The size of the shield gives you a rough indicator of how many players are members of its guild.  Click on a shield to learn more about the city.\n
			\n	
			Small monster icons represent zones.  Mouse over each zone to learn more, including its intended level range.\n
			\n
			Triangles represent runegates.  You can pass through teleporters at runegates to travel between them.  In most cases, you'll need the Traveler discipline to open the gates.\n
			\n
			Hammer and pick icons represent resource mines.  Resource mines are PvP hotspots.  If a guild owns a resource mine, resources are delivered to their city, and management of their city becomes much easier.  Visit the Shadowbane website, chronicle.ubi.com, for more information.\n
			\n
			Mouse over parts of the map to see territory outlines.  Guilds can conquer territories, allowing them to tax other cities within.  You can click on the territory to learn about its ruler.  Again, visit the website for more information on the system.\n
			\n
			Use the map filters, accessible through the button in the upper left corner, to increase or decrease the amount of information on the map.
